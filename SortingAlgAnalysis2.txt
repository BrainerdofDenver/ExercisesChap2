		E A S Y Q U E S T I  O N	i is @ index 0, "min" value is @ 1.
		A E S Y Q U E S T I  O N    Index i is swapped with the "min" value after checked. i @ 1,"min" @ 1
		  E                         Next lowest value @ i and remains in position
		A E S Y Q U E S T I  O N    i @ 2, "min" @ 6=E. Swapped
		A E E Y Q U S S T I  O N	i @ 3, "min" @ 9=I. Swapped
		A E E I Q U S S T Y  O N	i @ 4, "min" @ 11=N. Swapped
		A E E I N U S S T Y  O Q	i @ 5, "min" @ 10=O. Swapped
		A E E I N O S S T Y  U Q	i @ 6, "min" @ 11=Q. Swapped
		A E E I N O Q S T Y  U S	i @ 7, "min" @ 7=S.
		A E E I N O Q S T Y  U S	i @ 8, "min" @ 11=S. Swapped
		A E E I N O Q S S Y  U T	i @ 9, "min" @ 11=T. Swapped
		A E E I N O Q S S T  U Y	next couple iterations find the elements to be sorted

	for (int j = i; j > 0 && less(a[j], a[j-1]); j--)
	
	An array of 0.
	
2.1.9
	EASYSHELLSORTQUESTION	h= 1*3+1 continuosly while h is < array.length/3 : h is at position 13 : Q
	EAESSHELLSORTQUSYTION	h is devided by 3 and at position 4 : S
	EAELLHEONQIRSSOSTTUSY	h is devided again by 3 and results at position 1 : A
	AEEEHILLNOOQRSSSSTTUY	the array is completely sorted by a combination of h-sorted postitions and
							insertion sort.
